# Horiseon Bootcamp Challenge

Module 01 challenge for the U of U coding bootcamp

## Description

This project was completed as part of the Univeristy of Utah coding bootcamp. The goal was to take the code that was already given to you and organize it. This way if other developers are to read the code, it will be presented in a way that is easy to read and to follow. This project also allowed the site to be better optimized for search engines.
